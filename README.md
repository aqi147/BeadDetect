# BeadDetect
Welcome to the repository for our trained YOLOv5 object detection model! This repository provides all the necessary code and resources for using the "BeadDetect" model to track and calculate beads in X-ray images. You can quickly test our model with example images, infer results on your own images or videos, and explore its performance. The model has been designed to be user-friendly and easy to deploy.

#Note: Use the specified image size for practice. Play with different image sizes and confidence thresholds for your own dataset to compare the predictions

# Features
A pre-trained BD_model for beads detection
A ready-to-use Google Colab notebook for testing the model.
Example images (2 different sizes) and labels to evaluate the model's predictions.
Instructions for running inference on custom images or videos.

Please feel free to explore the code, make any necessary changes or improvements, and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

Thank you for checking out my project and happy coding!
