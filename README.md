# BeadDetect
In this repository, you will find all the necessary code and resources for using the "BeadDetect" model for tracking and calculating beads in X-ray images. This project was created with the goal to create a tool freely available for anyone to use.

Please feel free to explore the code, make any necessary changes or improvements, and let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions.

Thank you for checking out my project and happy coding!
